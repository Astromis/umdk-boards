# Unwired Mesh Development Kit (UMDK)

Unwired Development Kit is a set of boards for rapid prototyping Internet of Things devices — gateways, mesh networks, LoRa networks, and a variety of sensors, controls, and actuators, including widely used analog and digital industrial interfaces such as DALI, 0-10W PWM or RS-485.

The set consists of over 20 boards with 45x45mm base size (althought some boards are bigger). Main boards are UMDK-RF and UMDK-ONE — former is a baseboard for Unwired Mesh or Unwired Range Modules, and latter is a baseboard for Unwired One embedded computer. Each specific device prototype consists of a baseboard and single or multiple expansion boards with interfaces and controls needed for this devices. Unwired One can be an expansion too — in combination with UMDK-GATE or UMDK-GATE/E, which means it would work as Wi-Fi/Ethernet/USB interface for the UMDK-RF mainboard with Unwired Mesh or Unwired Range Module, but would not be able to control other expansion boards directly.
